This site shows the Julia versions of the Bayesian models described in Statistical Rethinking \citep{pMcElreath2020}.
Each page aims to contain all the code required to reproduce the results.
In other words, it should be possible to get the same output by just copying the code and the accompanying dataset.

The code used to generate this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/TuringModels.jl).
