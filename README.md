# TuringModels

[![][travis-img]][travis-url] |

## Introduction

This package contains Julia versions of the mcmc models contained in the R package "rethinking" associated with the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath. It is part of the [StatisticalRethinkingJulia](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia) Github organization of packages.

This package implements the models using [TuringLang/Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang).

## Versions

### v1.0.0

- Set upper bounds in [compat] section of Project.toml
- Activated CompatHelper (see CompatHelpper.jl)
- No longer uses Literate.jl. This version simply contains the models.
- Some of the models are pretty slow.

### v0.5

- Based on capturing the documentation by Literate.
- Literate.jl used to generate notebook versions

## Acknowledgements

Richard Torkar has taken the lead in developing the Turing versions of the models in chapter 8 and subsequent chapters. Martin Trapp has updated many models to recent versions of Turing.jl.

The TuringLang team and #turing contributors on Slack have been extremely helpful! The Turing examples by Cameron Pfiffer have been a great help and followed closely in several example scripts.
